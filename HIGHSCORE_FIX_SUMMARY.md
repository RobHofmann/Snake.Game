# High Score Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Anonymous Name Registration Issue**

- **Problem**: Player names were showing as "Anonymous" instead of entered nicknames
- **Root Cause**: Race conditions between old UIManager and new submission systems, context binding problems in debounce functions, input timing issues
- **Solution**:
  - Removed all conflicting high score submission logic from UIManager
  - Created dedicated HighScoreManager with proper context binding and robust name capture
  - Added multiple fallback mechanisms for name validation

### 2. **Duplicate Registration Issue**

- **Problem**: Multiple/random duplicate entries appearing in leaderboard
- **Root Cause**: Multiple event handlers causing duplicate submissions, insufficient submission tracking
- **Solution**:
  - Added submission state tracking in GameState (`canSubmitScore()`, `startSubmission()`, `completeSubmission()`)
  - Implemented game session tracking to prevent cross-game submissions
  - Cleaned up conflicting event handlers

## Architecture Changes

### New HighScoreManager System (`highScoreManager.js`)

```javascript
// Robust name capture with multiple fallbacks
let playerName = forcedName;
if (!playerName && this.nameInput) {
  const inputValue = this.nameInput.value.trim();
  if (inputValue && inputValue.length > 0) {
    playerName = inputValue;
  }
}
// Additional fallbacks: localStorage, Anonymous
```

### Enhanced GameState Tracking (`gameState.js`)

```javascript
canSubmitScore() {
    return !this.scoreSubmitted && !this.submissionInProgress && this.gameWasPlayed && this.score > 0;
}
```

### Clean UIManager (`uiManager.js`)

- Removed all high score submission logic
- No longer handles modal events or score submission
- Focuses solely on UI state management

### Updated Main.js Integration

```javascript
// High Score Manager events (NEW SYSTEM)
this.highScoreManager.on(
  "scoreSubmitted",
  async (playerName, score, gameTime) => {
    const success = await this.leaderboardManager.submitScore(
      playerName,
      score,
      gameTime
    );
    // Handle success/failure appropriately
  }
);
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Bulletproof Name Capture**: Multiple fallback mechanisms ensure player names are properly captured
2. **Submission State Tracking**: Prevents duplicate submissions with robust state management
3. **Game Session Tracking**: Unique game IDs prevent cross-game submission conflicts
4. **Proper Context Binding**: Arrow functions preserve 'this' context in event handlers
5. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and retry mechanisms
6. **Clean Separation of Concerns**: Dedicated HighScoreManager vs general UIManager

## Testing Instructions

1. Open the game at https://localhost:7296
2. Start a new game and achieve a score > 0
3. Enter a custom name in the high score modal
4. Verify the name appears correctly in the leaderboard
5. Play multiple games to ensure no duplicate registrations
6. Test various scenarios:
   - Enter key submission
   - Button click submission
   - Skip button (should register as "Anonymous")
   - Multiple rapid submissions (should be prevented)

## Files Modified

- ✅ `highScoreManager.js` - NEW dedicated high score system
- ✅ `main.js` - Updated with HighScoreManager integration
- ✅ `gameState.js` - Enhanced submission tracking
- ✅ `uiManager.js` - Cleaned up, removed conflicting logic

## Status: READY FOR TESTING

The high score registration system has been completely rewritten with a bulletproof approach that should eliminate both the "Anonymous" name issues and duplicate registration problems.
